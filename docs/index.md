## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of the exercises, notes, projects, and code snippets Iâ€™ve worked on while learning various concepts and technologies. Itâ€™s a living document that grows as I dive deeper into new topics and revisit previously learned material.

## Goals
1. Build a solid foundation in key programming concepts.
2. Solve algorithmic problems to improve problem-solving skills.
3. Develop hands-on projects to apply theoretical knowledge.
4. Explore advanced topics such as AI, computer vision, and data science.
5. Document my learning process and progress for future reference.
